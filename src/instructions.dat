Fill in the blocks with numbers 1-5.

Do not repeat a number in any row or column.
The numbers in each heavily outlined set
of squares, called cages, must combine
(in any order) to produce the target
number in the top corner of the cage using
the mathematical operation indicated.

Cages with just one box should be filled
in with the target number in the top corner.
A number can be repeated within a cage
as long as it is not in the same row or
column.
